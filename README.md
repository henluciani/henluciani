## What I do
- **Product strategy & discovery:** turn ambiguity into clear hypotheses, success metrics, and validated directions  
- **UX/UI & execution:** design flows that survive constraints (data, edge cases, performance, compliance)  
- **Design Ops:** design systems, governance, component standards, and scalable patterns  
- **Cross-functional leadership:** align Design × Engineering × Business around trade-offs and outcomes
